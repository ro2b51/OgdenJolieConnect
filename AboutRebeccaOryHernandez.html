    What is a Certified Cajun Product doing living in Ogden, Utah? Interesting story. Around 20 years ago, my husband was wrapping up a gig with NASA and needed a job as a professor, and one of our choices was Weber State University which is nestled against the mountain range here. It was so impressive visually, and I'm an artist, that we thought it was perfect. 
    We'd previously lived in Salt Lake City (before the Olympics) and enjoyed the climate so much. So we jumped out of the midwest and settled in Ogden. We've called Ogden home ever since. He teaches at Weber State and loves it, which means I love it, too. 
    I find Ogden a very "easy place to live" compared to other harsher environments. Sure, it has its challenges like any other place. However, compared to where we moved from. We've lived here longer than any other place. Crime is "gentler" and it's a wonderful place to raise a family. No, it's not crime-free but it's nothing in comparison... We have one son who is a teenager (Lord, help me) and he loves living in Ogden and won't let us move. Well...he always wants to have this place as our home. 
    I can't argue with that. We are fortunate to be in a very special place. I jokingly tell people to not move here - there's "nothing here" to do or see. Because I would like for Ogden to stay unspoiled - which I guess, is unrealistic given that ugly apartment buildings keep popping up everywhere. 

        
    Writer, designer (graphic, interior, garden) and Tech Mom graduate. I am masterful at taking ideas and turning them into pretty prose and pictures.
    Have an idea for a logo or pattern? Need a little bit of "umph" in your website? Need ideas of what can grow in your garden? Need color design for your home...Need some good food to feed your party? I can help! I enjoy blending "personality" with design (they call that "branding" now, which, when I was growing up pertained to livestock) you create a brand with copy and images. Need custom photographs for your website? I can make it beautiful with custom photography for your project. 
    A fun fact about me is that I'm Cajun. Certified. Authentic. Spicy. You betcha, that's me.
    Everyone who has had my cooking in Ogden has begged me to make them more! (I'm not bragging, not exaggerating, it's just how my family cooks good juju into our dishes). I was even a food writer for splashy food magazines back when those existed, and before Covid resulted in a lot of print going bye-bye. My personal chef business called, "Chef on the Go - Ogden" was a labor of love for ten years. Once Covid hit I folded it up for a bit. Occasionally I'll cook in a friend's kitchen to teach them how to properly create a fool-proof roux. But eventually they call me back because they are too distracted. (Rouxs take continuous focus and attention).

    Presently I'm honing in on learning new skills to take my creativity, writing chops and tenacity into the tech field. My goal is to work in the area of AI, UX/IX and design spaces that are as easy to use as possible, resulting in ROI.
    But I also have a strong affinity for cyber security. I'm not thinking too hard about it. As long as I have time to write, create, converse and cook, I'm a very content person.
