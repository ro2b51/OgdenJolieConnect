  <h1>Images and Links</h1>
  <p>We are going to discuss how to put images and links on a page. We will discuss several types of links. Also, how to make clickable images.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>External LInks</h2>
    <p>There are several types of links. There are internal, external, and locaal. External links go outside the server, meaning to another website.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" >W3Schools</a>     </li>

    <li><a href = https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp  >HTML Colors</a>    </li>
  </ul>
<h2>Local Links </h2>
<p>Local links are to another page in your same site. It is usually the navigation to direct you to another webpage. The navigation links are usually at the top of the page or down the left side. </p>
<h2> Images</h2>
<p>Use the img tag for an image. The src attribute allows you to put in the image file. The alt is for accessibility.</p>
    <img src = "images/techmomslogoblue.jpg" alt = "Tech Moms Logo">

<h2>Link within text</h2>
<p>To do a word as a link, just put the tags before and after the word. Such as if I wanted to link to <a href = "https://www.tech-moms.org/tech-moms" target = "_blank"> Tech-Moms</a>, I could just put tags in this paragraph.</p>
