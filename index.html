    <h2>Food Writing & Cooking </h2>
    <h4>(and yes...some recipes, too) from my home in Ogden, Utah.</h4>

        From a young age, I loved hearing stories from my family, working and playing in the garden or on the farm and then learning how to prepare food and make delicious dishes with my Mom and Maw-Maw (Cajun gradma), and learning about livestock, raising chickens and rounding up cattle. I knew exactly where our meats and seafood came from (my Ory Grandfather and Grandmother had a farm). I didn't realize how lucky I was at the time (do we ever?) in so many ways. The food wasn't called "farm to table" that's just the way we lived. 
        Flash forward to today - when I decided it was time to preserve those lessons that are making a comeback, experiences of celebrating, cooking and eating seasonally, and stories for my son about growing up in such an abundance of so much good, fresh food. I share this with you now - some recipes and the many cultural blends of the South Louisiana of my childhood. It's far beyond the touristy limitations you'll get in New Orleans, though there is an abundance of wonderful food there, too! I hope these stories, recipes and food bring a smile to your face and a yummy to your tummy! They are simple to create with my fool-proof recipes and (hopefully) videos to come. And if you enjoy reading and looking at beautiful photographs, all photos and images are created by me unless otherwise specified.</p> 
    </p>Not only will I share about my hometowns, but I will share some gems right here in Ogden. Just because I moved from a food capital does't mean I don't enjoy good food wherever I plant my feet. I have been known on occasion to do a little food writing when I'm impressed and want to share. Or call me and tell me where I should eat next!
